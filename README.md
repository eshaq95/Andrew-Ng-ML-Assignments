## Machine learning

This is my completed machine learning assigments for the free online course "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng. 
The course is available at this link: [Coursera - Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?).
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.
<br/>
<br/>
Topics include: 
- (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
- (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
- (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

In this repository I include my solutions to the MATLAB exersies on the course. Below are a few examples to of solutions:
