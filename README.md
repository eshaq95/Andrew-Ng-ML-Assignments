## Machine learning

This is my completed machine learning assigments for the free online course "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng. 
The course is available at this link: [Coursera - Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?).
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.
<br/>
<br/>
Topics include: 
- (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
- (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
- (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

<br/>

In this repository I include my solutions to the MATLAB exersies on the course. Below are a two examples of my solutions:

### 1. Linear Regression

In this part of this exercise, I implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 
<br/><br/>
**Problem description:** Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
