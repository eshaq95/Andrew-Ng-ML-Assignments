## Repository Contents

This repository includes MATLAB solutions for the following topics:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-Class Classification and Neural Networks
4. Neural Network Learning
5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance
6. Support Vector Machines
7. K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

## Featured Solutions

### 1. Linear Regression

**Problem**: Predict profits for a food truck franchise based on city population data.

**Scenario**: As the CEO of a restaurant franchise, you need to decide which city to expand to next. You have data on profits and populations from existing locations.

**Implementation**: Single-variable linear regression to model the relationship between population and profit.

### 2. Multi-class Classification

**Problem**: Recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9) using logistic regression and neural networks.

**Application**: This technique is widely used in automated systems for recognizing zip codes on mail envelopes and amounts on bank checks.

**Implementation**: 
- Extended logistic regression for one-vs-all classification
- Neural network approach for improved accuracy
